<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>Let's make the game iterative. In this stage, we'll adjust our game to resemble the classic version of Hangman. Players should now guess the letters in a word instead of inputting an entire word. If an attempt is successful, uncover the letter. We also need to add the lose condition — players have eight attempts to guess all letters that appear in the word. When players run out of attempts, the game ends.</p>

<p>Don't forget to get rid of the hints: replace all the letters in a word with hyphens at the beginning. Players input one lowercase letter at a time, so there is no need to worry about that.</p>

<p>Later on, we will also determine the win conditions, but in this stage, let's just see how well our player guesses the word on each attempt.</p>

<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>

<p>Your game should work as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players have exactly eight attempts to guess the word by entering letters one by one. Asking for a letter, print: <code class="java">Input a letter:</code>.<span style="color: #ff4363;"><strong> </strong></span>If a player uncovered all the letters, but some attempts are still left, the program must continue to ask for input until all the tries are exhausted;</li>
	<li>If the letter doesn't appear in the word, the computer takes one try away – even if a user has already suggested this letter – and prints <code class="java">That letter doesn't appear in the word.</code>;</li>
	<li>If all attempts are exhausted, the game ends; the program shows a final message (<code class="java">Thanks for playing!</code>). Otherwise, players can continue to input letters;</li>
	<li>We continue to stick with the word list from the previous stage: <code class="java">python</code>, <code class="java">java</code>, <code class="java">kotlin</code>, <code class="java">javascript</code>. It ensures that your program is tested reliably.</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="alert alert-warning">Please, make sure that the output format of your program follows the example precisely. Pay attention to the empty lines between attempts and at the end.</div></p>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>The greater-than symbol followed by a space (<code class="java">&gt; </code>) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
